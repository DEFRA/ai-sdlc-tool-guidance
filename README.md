# AI Tools for Defra Pilot Teams
Version 1.3

This document explains what AI tools you can use as part of the Defra AI pilot. It covers how data is used by these tools, what privacy settings are in place, what auditing and logging is in place, and what compliance and regulations they follow.

## Who can use these AI tools

These AI tools are allowed in the Defra pilot, but only if you follow these restrictions:

### 1. Only pilot teams can use these tools
We are running a pilot with a small group of teams. What we learn will help guide a wider rollout within Defra.

**If you are not part of the pilot, do not use any AI tools.**

### 2. Use only the tools in this guidance
Teams on the pilot must use only the tools listed in this guidance, and no other AI tools. If you want to use another tool, contact the Defra AI Capabilities and Enablement - details below. 

**Do not use any AI tools that are not listed in this guidance.**

### 3. Use only public and OFFICIAL data
You must only enter public and OFFICIAL data into these tools. You must not enter OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE data into these tools.

**Do not enter OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE data into these tools.**

These are official government security classifications, as defined in the [Government Security Classifications Policy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications/government-security-classifications-policy-quick-read-html).
