[Upload the summary docs for each of the tools in the guidance, use deep reasearch thinking model (o3 - deep research for example)]

# Context
We are maintaining a tool guidance website that explains what AI tools can be used as part of an AI pilot. It covers how data is used by these tools, what privacy settings are in place, what auditing and logging is in place, and what compliance and regulations they follow.

We need to maintain this current list of tools to ensure that our guidance is kept up to date for the latest version of each tool.

# ANALYSIS PHASE
I want you to review each of the attached files one by one and then search the web for the latest information on each tool.

# IMPLIMENATATION PHASE
For each tool, you should compare the latest information for each tool you found on the web with the uploaded guidance for each tool and identify any discrepancies if there are any.  If the existing tool guidance is still correct, then also confirm it's still valid.

Further notes:
- Use only official sources for information
- Create a report-style critique for each tool with a short assessment of the summary guidance
- Generate only one consolidated report

# VERIFICATION PHASE
When complete, you should have a list of each of the tools uploaded with commentary on the guidance validity for the latest version of each of the tools.

Ask any questions if this is not clear.
