# Claude Code - Detailed Guide
*(Generated by AI, ChatGPT Deep Research, on June 23rd 2025)*

## What Claude Code does

Claude Code is an AI coding assistant that works in your terminal. You install it on your computer and use it to help with software development tasks.

**Key features:**
- Understands large codebases
- Generates and fixes code
- Runs tests and commands
- Creates pull requests
- Works with your existing tools (VS Code, Git)

You stay in control - Claude Code asks for permission before making changes to your files or running commands.

## How your data stays private

### Your code stays on your computer

Claude Code runs locally on your machine. It does not upload your entire codebase to the cloud. Instead, it only sends specific questions and code snippets to get answers.

**What this means:**
- Your full codebase is not stored remotely
- Only the code you ask about is sent for analysis
- You approve all changes before they happen

### Enterprise privacy controls

If your department uses Claude Enterprise, administrators can:
- Stop users from sending feedback to Anthropic
- Turn off usage tracking completely
- Disable error reporting

**To disable data sharing, set this environment variable:**
```
CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1
```

## Legal terms and data rights

### You own your code

Under Anthropic's commercial terms:
- You keep ownership of code you write
- You own the code Claude generates for you
- Anthropic cannot use your code to train their models without permission

### Data processing agreement

Anthropic acts as a data processor for government customers. This means:
- Your department controls how data is used
- Anthropic only processes data to provide the service
- Standard EU data protection clauses apply
- UK and EU privacy laws are followed

**Important:** Review these documents before using Claude Code:
- Commercial Terms of Service
- Privacy Policy
- Data Processing Addendum

## Where your data is stored

### Default server location

By default, Claude processes requests using servers in the United States.

### UK data residency options

For departments that need data to stay in the UK or EU:

**Option 1: AWS Bedrock**
- Can use AWS regions in the UK
- Meets government security standards

**Option 2: Google Cloud Vertex AI**
- Available in London and Frankfurt regions
- Keeps data within EU jurisdiction

**Action needed:** Contact Anthropic to arrange UK/EU data hosting if required.

## Data security

### Data in transit
All data sent between Claude Code and Anthropic's servers is encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security). This prevents anyone from reading your data while it travels over the internet.

### Data at rest
Anthropic encrypts stored data using industry-standard encryption (AES-256). However, Anthropic can still read your prompts and responses to provide the service.

**Note:** Make sure your computer's hard drive is encrypted if you store sensitive government data locally.

### How long data is kept

**Standard retention:** 30 days maximum

**Enterprise options:**
- Reduce to 7 days or shorter
- Zero data retention (data deleted immediately after processing)

**Exception:** If content violates usage policies, Anthropic may keep it for up to 2 years for investigation.

## Monitoring and audit logs

### What gets logged

Enterprise customers get audit logs that show:
- Who logged in and when
- When new conversations started
- When files were uploaded
- User actions and timestamps

**Important:** Logs do not include the actual content of your code or conversations.

### Accessing audit logs

Administrators can:
- Export logs from the Anthropic Console
- Download 180 days of activity data
- Integrate with SIEM tools for security monitoring

### Real-time monitoring

Claude Code supports OpenTelemetry for real-time logging. You can send usage data to tools like Splunk or CloudWatch.

## User access and permissions

### Single sign-on (SSO)

Connect Claude Code to your existing login system:
- Azure Active Directory
- Google Workspace
- Other SAML/OAuth providers

This ensures staff use official credentials and two-factor authentication.

### Role-based access

**Available roles:**
- **Primary Owner:** Full administrative rights
- **Admin/Owner:** Can change settings and export data
- **Developer:** Can use Claude Code API
- **Member:** Basic chat access only

**Domain restrictions:** Limit access to your organisation's email domain to prevent unauthorised sign-ups.

### Automatic user management

Use SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) to:
- Automatically create accounts for new staff
- Remove access when people leave
- Sync with your HR systems
