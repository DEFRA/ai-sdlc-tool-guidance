*(Generated by AI, ChatGPT Deep Research, on June 23rd 2025)*

## What Google Gemini does

Google Gemini is an AI chat assistant you access through a web browser or mobile app. It answers questions, helps write content, and connects with other Google services to help with work tasks.

**Key features:**
- Answers questions and explains topics
- Writes and edits documents
- Analyses and summarises content
- Creates images and presentations
- Integrates with Gmail, Drive, and other Google apps
- Offers voice conversations ("Gemini Live")

**How to access it:** Sign in with a Google Account at `gemini.google.com` or use the mobile app.

**Two versions available:**
- **Free version:** For personal use with basic features
- **Enterprise version:** For organisations through Google Workspace

## Control your privacy settings

### Free version privacy

**Default behaviour:**
- Saves your chat history for 18 months
- May use your conversations to improve the AI
- Human reviewers might read your chats to train the system

**Take control:**
1. **Turn off chat history:** Go to My Activity settings and disable "Gemini Apps Activity"
2. **Change retention period:** Choose 3, 18, or 36 months in your Google Account settings  
3. **Delete conversations:** Remove individual chats or your entire history anytime

**Important:** Even with history off, Google keeps conversations for 72 hours to process feedback and maintain service quality.

### Enterprise version privacy

**Better privacy protections:**
- Your chats are not used to train Google's AI
- No human reviewers read your conversations
- Data stays within your organisation's Google Workspace
- Follows the same security rules as Gmail and Google Drive

**Administrator controls:**
- IT teams can turn Gemini on or off for different users
- Chat data inherits your organisation's data protection policies
- Retention settings will be configurable by administrators (coming soon)

### Protect sensitive information

**Never enter:**
- Classified or confidential data
- Personal information of citizens
- Security credentials or passwords
- Commercially sensitive information

**Why:** On the free version, human reviewers may see your conversations.

## Know your legal rights

### Free version terms

Using Gemini with a personal Google Account means:
- Google's standard Terms of Service apply
- Google Ireland Limited provides the service in Europe
- Your conversations may be used to improve Google's services
- You must follow Google's AI usage policies (no illegal or harmful content)

### Enterprise version terms

Using Gemini through Google Workspace means:
- Your organisation's Google Workspace agreement applies
- Google acts as a data processor (you control how data is used)
- Your conversations are not used to train Google's AI
- Same legal protections as other Google Workspace services
- GDPR compliance through existing data processing agreements

**Important documents to review:**
- Google Terms of Service
- Gemini Apps Privacy Notice  
- Google Workspace Terms (for enterprise users)
- Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy

## Understand data storage

### Where your data goes

**Processing location:** Google's global data centres worldwide

**Important:** Google does not guarantee your data stays in any specific country during AI processing. This means:
- Data may be processed outside the UK or EU
- Processing happens wherever Google has available capacity
- Standard encryption and legal protections apply to international transfers

### Enterprise data residency

**Limited regional control:**
- AI processing happens globally regardless of settings
- Saved documents can be stored in your chosen region (UK/EU)
- Chat history location follows global processing rules
- Google Ireland manages European users' data

**For UK government use:** Treat any input to Gemini as potentially leaving UK jurisdiction during processing.

### Data security measures

**Data in transit:** All communications use HTTPS/TLS encryption

**Data at rest:**  
- All stored content is encrypted on Google's servers
- Enterprise data gets the same protection as Gmail and Google Drive
- Consumer data is logically separated by account

**Client-side encryption:** Not compatible with Gemini - the AI cannot read customer-encrypted content

### How long data is kept

**Free version:**
- Chat history: 18 months by default (you can change this to 3-36 months)
- Deleted conversations: Removed immediately from your account
- Human review data: Up to 3 years if selected for training (anonymised)

**Enterprise version:**
- Chat history: Currently 18 months default
- Administrator controls: Coming soon for custom retention periods  
- Training data: Your conversations are never used for this purpose

**Temporary storage:** Google keeps recent chats for 72 hours to maintain service quality

## Track usage and activities

### Available audit logs

**Current capabilities:**
- Track when Gemini accesses your Google Drive files

### Future logging capabilities

Google plans to expand audit logging to cover:
- Gmail integration activities
