# Cursor - Summary Guidance

This is a high-level summary of the [detailed report](cursor-detailed.md)

## Privacy Settings

When Privacy Mode is enabled, Cursor ensures that your source code and prompts are never stored or used for training. Data remains only in transient memory or short-term encrypted caches and is discarded immediately after processing.

Privacy Mode is available for all users. It must be enabled manually for free and pro accounts.  It is automatically enforced for Business and Enterprise accounts.

## Data Management

### Multi-Regional Processing

Although a UK user's requests may first hit a London AWS data center for low latency, most processing occurs on US-based infrastructure (with some parts also on Azure and Google Cloud). Custom AI models, hosted via Fireworks, might run in the US, Europe, or Asia.

Even if you configure your own API keys, all requests will still route through Cursor's backend.
  
### Data in Transit  

Data is protected in transit using TLS 1.2, and any code that is stored is encrypted with AES-256. Minimal retention is practiced, as code is primarily processed in memory.

### Data at Rest

Cursor may store vector embeddings and metadata (not raw source code) for features like codebase indexing, ensuring that searchable artifacts can't be reversed to reveal original content.

When privacy mode is enabled no data is stored persistently. Data remains only in transient memory or short-term encrypted caches and is discarded immediately after processing.

### Third-Party Processing  

Code data may be sent to US-based AI model providers (such as OpenAI and Anthropic) under zero data retention agreements, ensuring that your data is not stored beyond immediate processing.

## Auditing

Its logging practices, especially for privacy-mode requests, are designed to avoid capturing sensitive code details.

## Access Controls

Cursor applies least-privilege and multi-factor authentication for internal access.

For enterprise users, an admin dashboard provides aggregated usage metrics (e.g., number of queries and completions) without retaining the content of your code.

Cursor integrates with enterprise identity systems (SSO with SAML 2.0/OIDC) and enforces role-based access. Even if individual settings could be adjusted locally, the backend defaults ensure Privacy Mode is maintained.

## Compliance & Regulatory Considerations

**GDPR & Data Minimisation**  
Cursor's policies align with GDPR principlesâ€”emphasising data minimisation and providing user rights such as data deletion. However, UK government users must note that data is ultimately processed in the US (or other jurisdictions) under mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses.

**Certifications & Assurance**  
Cursor is SOC 2 Type II certified, underscoring its commitment to security and operational best practices, though it does not offer a UK-sovereign cloud option.
